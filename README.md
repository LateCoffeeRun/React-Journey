# React Playground 🚀
Welcome to my React Playground!

This is where I experiment, learn, and document my journey with React.  
Expect to see code snippets, mini-projects, and practice exercises as I explore different concepts in React and its ecosystem.

## 📚 What’s inside
🔹 Small experiments with React fundamentals  
🔹 Notes & examples of React hooks  
🔹 Practice projects to strengthen concepts  
🔹 UI experiments and component patterns  
🔹 Any random "what if I try this?" ideas 💡

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹React (main focus)  
🔹JavaScript / TypeScript (depending on experiments)  
🔹Vite / Create React App for quick setups  
🔹TailwindCSS / Styled-components (sometimes for styling practice)

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This repo is constantly evolving as I learn.  
Feel free to browse around — but don’t expect polished production-ready apps. This is for learning & fun! 🎉

## 🤝 Contributions
This is mainly my personal learning space, but if you have suggestions, ideas, or helpful resources, feel free to open an issue or PR!

## ⭐ Goals
🔹Build intuition with React fundamentals  
🔹Explore ecosystem tools (React Router, Redux, Zustand, etc.)  
🔹Improve component design skills  
🔹Practice project structure & best practices
